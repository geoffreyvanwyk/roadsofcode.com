I could have started computer programming much earlier than I actually did. In my final year in high school, one of my teachers asked if I was interested in computer science. To my regret, I answered "No" without thinking.

Instead, I decided to study chemical engineering at university. In our high school physics and chemistry handbook, I had read about the reaction between nitrogen and hydrogen to form ammonia and heat. What was amazing was that the reaction also takes place in the opposite direction at the same time, which means that when heat is applied to ammonia, nitrogen and hydrogen is obtained! The question arises: which reaction will win? Will all of the nitrogen and hydrogen be consumed, leaving only ammonia and heat, or will the opposite happen? The logical answer seems to be that the faster reaction will win.

The rate of reaction is directly proportional to the concentration of the chemicals. If we start with nitrogen and hydrogen, the forward reaction will initially be faster than the reverse reaction, because we start without ammonia. As the forward reaction progresses, the rate of the reaction lowers because the concentrations of nitrogen and hydrogen lower as they are consumed. As ammonia and heat are formed, their concentrations increase thereby increasing the rate of the reverse reaction. After some time, the rates of the two reactions will be the same, and the amounts of all the chemicals will not change from that point on.

The reaction produces heat as well, which increases the temperature of the gas mixture. Not all nitrogen and hydrogen are consumed, but an equilibrium is reached at a certain temperature.
